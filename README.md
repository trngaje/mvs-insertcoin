## Players
The icon system at the top of the screen illustrates the total players the game allows (Mame Arcade only). This changes depending on the amount of players and whether they are simultaneous play (co-op or oppenent) or if the game supports multiple players but only individually (take turns between lives or levels).

![Players](/parts/icons/1p.png) is an example of a single player

![Players](/parts/icons/2p-sim.png) is an example of a two player Simultaneous game play

![Players](/parts/icons/4p-alt.png) is an example of a 4 player alternating play mechanic.
